# ENGR_103_FINAL

// This code is a gambling game that can be played in a succession of four levels. Each level the number you guess requires a higher level of accuracy to be considered correct and allowing you to move onto the next level.
// The simple rules are that you can only guess an LED 1-10 that you would like to have as your guess, every time you guess you must re-enter your answer or change it. 
// The arduino uses button inputs, switch inputs, and outputs on LED's and the speakers.
